# Random-Shape Generator
Surprisingly delightful modernist-looking random shapes.

## How It Works
Right now, this is super simple. Download the files and load index.html.
Click anywhere in the page when you're ready for a new shape.

## Future Additions
It might be nice to add the ability to capture a shape as a GIF or JPEG, or
perhaps some instructions.
