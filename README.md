# Random-Shape Generator
Surprisingly delightful modernist-looking random shapes.

## How It Works
Right now, this is super simple. Download the files and load index.html,
reloading the page when you're ready for a new shape.

## Future Additions
It might be nice to add features such as automatically changing shapes every
so often, or the ability to capture a shape as a GIF or JPEG.
